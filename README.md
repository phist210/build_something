# Build Something

This is a class assignment that requires students to learn something new and build upon that knowledge. I chose Ruby and a Twitter bot that can track tweets depending on tracked keywords or post tweets as my assignment.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

*A twitter account, using developer tools to make an app.*

Alternatively, use the dummy account I set up for testing this.

```
Consumer API Key: mDPelYmcdf2LAWOkqUSifVcKG
Consumer Secret Key: qQpM55U36XmPXdaCrwtH92yxq9abBxm8eD9AaEq455pYkxpvjh
Access Token: 853344652036120577-thGfdqlDIXEc4TWOkr3hFWjFgqRU5TZ
Access Token Secret: taahRUJQHNnD3Og2bQkh42gwzL6mNOugVmo4BWMBcGGZH
```

## Deployment

After configuring bot.rb to match access and consumer key data, open terminal/command line and run:

```
ruby bot.rb
```

## Built With
